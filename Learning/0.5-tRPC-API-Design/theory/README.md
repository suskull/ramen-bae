# ðŸ“š tRPC Theory & Concepts

This directory contains the theoretical foundations and core concepts behind tRPC. Understanding these principles will help you build better APIs and make informed architectural decisions.

## ðŸ“‹ Theory Modules

1. **[Type Safety Fundamentals](./type-safety-fundamentals.md)**
   - What is type safety and why it matters
   - Runtime vs compile-time validation
   - The TypeScript inference system in tRPC

2. **[API Design Principles](./api-design-principles.md)**
   - RESTful vs RPC design patterns
   - When to use queries vs mutations
   - Organizing procedures and routers

3. **[Validation Strategy](./validation-strategy.md)**
   - Input/output validation patterns
   - Zod schema design best practices
   - Error handling and user feedback

4. **[Performance Considerations](./performance-considerations.md)**
   - Request batching and caching
   - Serialization and data transfer
   - Optimization strategies

5. **[Architecture Patterns](./architecture-patterns.md)**
   - Monolithic vs modular router design
   - Context and middleware patterns
   - Scalability considerations

## ðŸŽ“ Assessment Questions

Test your understanding with these questions:

### Type Safety
- What are the benefits of end-to-end type safety?
- How does tRPC achieve type inference without code generation?
- When might you choose runtime-only validation over compile-time checking?

### API Design
- When should you use a query vs a mutation?
- How do you decide what should be a separate procedure?
- What are the trade-offs between flat vs nested router structures?

### Validation
- What's the difference between input and output validation?
- How do you handle conditional validation requirements?
- When should you use transformations vs pure validation?

### Performance
- How does request batching improve performance?
- What are the serialization costs of different data types?
- When should you implement caching strategies?
