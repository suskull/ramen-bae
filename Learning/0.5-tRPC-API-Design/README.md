# 🔗 Task 0.5: tRPC & Type-Safe API Design

**Status**: 📋 **PENDING**  
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 days  
**Difficulty**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Intermediate-Advanced)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

### Primary Goals
- [ ] Understand tRPC benefits over traditional REST
- [ ] Master type-safe client-server communication
- [ ] Learn Zod schema validation
- [ ] Implement queries, mutations, and subscriptions
- [ ] Practice error handling and middleware

### Secondary Goals  
- [ ] Learn tRPC router composition
- [ ] Understand procedure context and authentication
- [ ] Practice input/output transformations
- [ ] Learn performance optimization techniques

## 🏗️ What You'll Build
