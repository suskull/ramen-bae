## 🎯 Learning Objectives

### Overall Goal
Transform from frontend developer to confident full-stack developer through hands-on practice with real backend concepts.

### Subtask Objectives
- **0.1**: Master HTTP methods, status codes, and RESTful API design
- **0.2**: Understand database design, relationships, and SQL fundamentals  
- **0.3**: Learn containerization with Docker and development environments
- **0.4**: Implement authentication, security, and best practices
- **0.5**: Build type-safe APIs with tRPC and input validation

## 📊 Progress Tracking

| Subtask | Status | Completion Date | Key Skills Gained |

## 📚 Learning Resources

### Documentation
- [Learning Journal](./.taskmaster/docs/learning-journal.md) - Daily progress & insights
- [Learning Roadmap](./.taskmaster/docs/learning-roadmap.md) - 8-week structured plan

### External Resources
- [MDN HTTP Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods)
- [PostgreSQL Tutorial](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/)
- [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/)

## 🔗 Integration with Main Project

Each learning subtask directly prepares you for the main Ramen Bae e-commerce project:

- **HTTP Skills** → API routes for products, users, orders
- **Database Skills** → Product catalog, user management, order processing  
- **Docker Skills** → Self-hosted Supabase development environment
- **Auth Skills** → User registration, login, protected routes
- **tRPC Skills** → Type-safe APIs across the entire application

## 💡 Learning Philosophy

### Hands-On First
Every concept is learned through building real, working code that you can test and experiment with.

### Connect to Frontend Knowledge
Each backend concept is explained in terms of frontend patterns you already understand.

### Build Real Projects
Instead of toy examples, you build components that could be used in production applications.

### Document Everything
Capture insights, challenges, and "aha!" moments to reinforce learning and help future you.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Current Focus**: If you haven't completed 0.1, start there
2. **Next Steps**: Move to 0.2 Database Design when ready
3. **Daily Practice**: Spend 1-2 hours per subtask with hands-on coding
4. **Document Progress**: Update learning journal with daily insights

## 🎯 Success Criteria

You'll know you're ready for the main project when you can:

- [ ] Build complete REST APIs with proper HTTP methods and status codes
- [ ] Design normalized database schemas with proper relationships
- [ ] Set up and manage Docker development environments
- [ ] Implement secure authentication with JWT and middleware
- [ ] Create type-safe APIs with input validation and error handling

**Remember**: Every senior backend developer started exactly where you are now. The key is consistent practice with real code, not just reading theory. You've got this! 🚀
