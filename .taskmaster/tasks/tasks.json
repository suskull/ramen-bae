Topics include: HTTP methods and status codes (create test endpoints for each), database design principles (design entity-relationship diagrams), API design patterns (build simple CRUD examples), Docker fundamentals (run basic containers), authentication concepts (implement basic JWT), and SQL basics (practice queries). Create proof-of-concept mini-applications to understand each concept deeply. Document learning in .taskmaster/docs/learning-journal.md. Set up development tools: pgAdmin, Postman/Insomnia, Docker Desktop. This task should take 1-2 weeks and result in strong foundational knowledge before proceeding to main features.",
