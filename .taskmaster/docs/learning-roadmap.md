## 🧠 **Core Learning Concepts**

### **Database Mastery**
```sql
-- From simple selects...
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price > 10;

-- To complex joins...
SELECT p.name, c.name as category, COUNT(r.id) as review_count
FROM products p
JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.id
LEFT JOIN reviews r ON p.id = r.product_id
GROUP BY p.id, p.name, c.name;
```

### **API Design Evolution**
```typescript
// From basic REST...
app.get('/api/products', (req, res) => {
  res.json(products);
});

// To type-safe tRPC...
export const productRouter = router({
  getAll: publicProcedure
    .input(z.object({ category: z.string().optional() }))
    .query(({ input }) => {
      // Fully typed input and output
      return db.products.findMany({ where: input });
    }),
});
```

### **Authentication Understanding**
```typescript
// Understanding the flow...
const authFlow = {
  registration: "User → Hash Password → Store in DB → Return Success",
  login: "User → Verify Password → Generate JWT → Return Token",
  protected: "Request → Verify JWT → Allow/Deny Access"
};
```

### **Container Orchestration**
```yaml
# Understanding service communication
services:
  nextjs:
    build: .
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: postgresql://user:pass@postgres:5432/db
      #                                  ^^^^^^^^
      #                                  Service name, not localhost!
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
```
